# Traffic Sign Recognition Project

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to recognize traffic signs, a critical component for autonomous vehicles. The system aims to enhance road safety by enabling vehicles to accurately interpret traffic signs in real-time, adapting to various environmental conditions like poor lighting and occlusions.

## Problem Statement
Traffic accidents cause over 38,000 fatalities annually in the U.S. alone, with millions injured. Human error in recognizing traffic signs is a significant contributor to these accidents. This project addresses this challenge by developing a robust Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) system to:
- Accurately detect and classify traffic signs in real-time
- Enable autonomous vehicles to interpret road regulations
- Function reliably across diverse environmental conditions
- Reduce traffic-related fatalities and injuries

## Dataset
The model uses the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign), which contains:
- 43 different traffic sign classes
- Over 50,000 images (39,209 training + 12,630 testing)
- Images resized to 30x30 pixels with RGB channels

## Model Architecture
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture consists of:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (5,5), activation='relu', input_shape=(30,30,3)))
model.add(Conv2D(32, (5,5), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPool2D(2,2))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPool2D(2,2))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(43, activation='softmax'))
